# hash-cracker
this is a hash cracker written in java.
it supports on the momend only md5 hashes with cpu cracking.
other fetures like gpu cracking comes later because I first want to make it faster.

max speeds with i7 4702MQ = 2500 KHs/ 2,5 MHz

So you make the program work:
- compile the jar file.
- download a wordlist.
- open terminal/command prompt.
- tipe: java -jar md5.jar ( your md5 hash), ( your wordlist )

Example: java -jar md5.jar f96bd3e1b9e0a1a2c0c2e6c2deb4aa77 'C:\Users\mh123hack\Downloads\wordlist.txt'
